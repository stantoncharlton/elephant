    <h1 class="">How do we do it?</h1>

    <p class="elephant-about-p1 blue-text">We use a <span class="gotham-bold">job-centric</span> approach which ensures
      your company achieves it's job-centric goals, while simultaneously the goals of quality and failure prevention.
      The key: they happen together.</p>
    <br>

    <p>
      Your data is stored in disparate systems for document management, field data, communications, inventory, field
      bulletins, and QA procedures.

    </p>

    <p>The solution is <b class='warning-text'>not</b> adding another disparate system. It will not work.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="elephant-about-p1">Elephant is a holistic approach, because that's what works.</p>


    <br>

    <p>

    <h1 class="">Countless disparate systems</h1>

    <p>Most employees report that they tend to not use these systems because they are hard to use, hard to find, and
      generally do not fit into the process.</p>

    <h1>Reducing Failures and Non-Productive Time</h1>
    <br>

    <p class="elephant-about-p1">One of our biggest goals at Elephant is reducing mistakes in the process.</p>

    <p>Elephant uses the latest technology and human behavior research to curb problems before they happen.
      On average 25% of service time in upstream is categorized as non-productive time. Of that, 75% is usually
      accounted for by out-of-date procedures, bad communications, or lack of accountability.
      Elephant is stopping this.
